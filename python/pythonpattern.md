## Abstract
This github repository is dedicated to addressing the practical aspects of implementing sustainable CDC data replication solutions, primarily 
through the use of documenting worked examples of how to build CDC solutions that are easy to operate, manage and maintain.

This document is a reflection of the author's experiences in deploying CDC solutions at large enterprise clients, and contains 
many practical observations and recommendations. 
It is intended to be read in conjuction with 
the [official product documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/idr/11.4.0?topic=change-data-capture-cdc-replication), 
which is the definitive IBM-provided reference point of information for CDC Software Solutions.
