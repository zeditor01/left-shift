# README

This repository provides documentation and code samples for various "Left-Shift" Data Integration patterns for mainframe data.

So many "modern applications" are based on the pattern of copying the data off the mainframe to another persistence store in order to support web, clound and mobile applications.
Sometimes this is a great data intergation pattern, and there are many data movement technologies to enable this pattern.
However, Movement of data involves software costs, implementation projects, operational automation and adds a layer of technical debt to your infrastructure.... and it is not always warranted.

The examples in this repository are a range of methods to access mainframe data in-situ, without incurring the cost and effort of moving it.
The worked examples are intended to provide a practical insight into the effort to deploy these patterns, so that they may be considered alongside Right-Shift and Openshift patterns of Data Integration.
